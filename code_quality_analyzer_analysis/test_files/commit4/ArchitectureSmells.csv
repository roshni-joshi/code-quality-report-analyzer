Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
input,org.apache.maven.internal.impl,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.apache.maven.internal.impl; org.apache.maven.session.scope.internal; org.apache.maven.internal.impl
input,org.apache.maven.model.io,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.apache.maven.model.building; org.apache.maven.model
input,org.apache.maven.cli.internal,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.apache.maven.plugin.internal
input,org.apache.maven,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.apache.maven; org.apache.maven.internal.impl; org.apache.maven
input,org.apache.maven.model,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.apache.maven.model; org.apache.maven.project; org.apache.maven.project.validation; org.apache.maven.model.validation; org.apache.maven.model
input,org.apache.maven.plugin,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature.
