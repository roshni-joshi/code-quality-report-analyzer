Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
code-quality-analyzer-backend,code.quality.analyzer.controller,CommitsAnalysisController,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because getOneCommitAnalysis is more interested in members of the type: CommitsAnalysisService
code-quality-analyzer-backend,code.quality.analyzer.controller,CommitsAnalysisController,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because getTrendAnalysis is more interested in members of the type: CommitsAnalysisService
code-quality-analyzer-backend,code.quality.analyzer.controller,CommitsAnalysisController,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because getHotspotAnalysis is more interested in members of the type: CommitsAnalysisService
code-quality-analyzer-backend,code.quality.analyzer.service,CommitsAnalysisServiceImplTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because testGenerateOneCommitReportForRemoteBranch is more interested in members of the type: CommitsAnalysisService
code-quality-analyzer-backend,code.quality.analyzer.service,CommitsAnalysisServiceImplTest,Feature Envy,The tool detected a instance of this smell because testGenerateTrendAnalysisReportForRemoteBranch is more interested in members of the type: CommitsAnalysisService
code-quality-analyzer-backend,code.quality.analyzer.util,Constants,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: EMPTY; ONE; REPORT_PATH; REPO_PATH; REPO_SUFFIX; BRANCH_PREFIX; REMOTE_ORIGIN; TEST_REMOTE_BRANCH; TEST_REMOTE_COMMIT_ID_1; TEST_BRANCH; TEST_REPO_URL; TEST_COMMIT_ID_1; TEST_COMMIT_ID_2; TEST_COMMIT_ID_3; TEST_COMMIT_ID_4; TEST_COMMIT_ID_5; TEST_USER_1; TEST_USER_2; TEST_REPO_URL_ALLCOMMITS; TEST_TOTAL_COMMITS; TEST_TOTAL_COMMITS_2; TEST_ZERO; TEST_LOCALHOST; TEST_PORT; TEST_HTTP_STATUS; ONE_COMMIT_URL; TREND_URL; HOTSPOT_URL; ANALYSIS_SERVICE_TEST_RESPONSE
code-quality-analyzer-backend,code.quality.analyzer.util,Constants,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: EMPTY; ONE; REPORT_PATH; REPO_PATH; REPO_SUFFIX; BRANCH_PREFIX; REMOTE_ORIGIN; TEST_REMOTE_BRANCH; TEST_REMOTE_COMMIT_ID_1; TEST_BRANCH; TEST_REPO_URL; TEST_COMMIT_ID_1; TEST_COMMIT_ID_2; TEST_COMMIT_ID_3; TEST_COMMIT_ID_4; TEST_COMMIT_ID_5; TEST_USER_1; TEST_USER_2; TEST_REPO_URL_ALLCOMMITS; TEST_TOTAL_COMMITS; TEST_TOTAL_COMMITS_2; TEST_ZERO; TEST_LOCALHOST; TEST_PORT; TEST_HTTP_STATUS; ONE_COMMIT_URL; TREND_URL; HOTSPOT_URL; ANALYSIS_SERVICE_TEST_RESPONSE
code-quality-analyzer-backend,code.quality.analyzer.model,OneCommitAnalysisRequest,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
code-quality-analyzer-backend,code.quality.analyzer.model,HotspotAnalysisRequest,Unnecessary Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class contains only a few data members without any method implementation, that indicates that the abstraction might not be required. Following fields are declared in this class: 
code-quality-analyzer-backend,code.quality.analyzer.model,TrendAnalysisRequest,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): AnalysisServiceRequest
code-quality-analyzer-backend,code.quality.analyzer.exception,CommitsAnalysisExceptionHandler,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
